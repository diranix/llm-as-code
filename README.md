LaC is a protocol for building LLM applications the way IaC builds infrastructure: behavior is declared in versioned artifacts, not improvised in prompts. An application is a folder of plain files - a compose declaration, law files with explicit authority levels, and a commands module. The engine is generic and knows nothing about any particular application.

This repository holds the LaC specification ([SPEC.md](SPEC.md)) and the reference engine. The engine is intentionally small: a compose loader with a strict parser, a context assembler that loads law in trust order (L1 then L2, with L3 kept out of the system channel), a REPL, and an agentic loop where free-form language and canonical `!commands` are two roads into the same code.

## Why LaC

The premise is a threat model, not a convenience: **an LLM application must protect the user's machine from its own model.** A model can be talked into anything - a note in a document, a line in a file, a stray instruction in retrieved data. So the guarantee cannot live in the model's good behavior; it has to live in structure and code the model does not control.

- **Behavior as code.** Prose asks; code enforces. Where a normal app improvises rules in a system prompt, LaC turns the load-bearing parts into deterministic mechanism - commands are modules, the write perimeter is a filesystem jail, consent is a real gate on stdin. Prose remains the law for the persona; it never guards the disk.
- **Capability, not promises.** A wrong action must be survivable. The engine's hands are caged (every path resolves through a realpath jail rooted at the memory folder); the model may misjudge, and the machine still stands.
- **Levels are authority.** L0 is code (the engine and command modules - executes, never enters the context). L1 is limits, L2 is behavior - both always in context. L3 is data - all stored content, with zero authority, never instructions. On any conflict the higher level wins, and nothing at L3 is promoted by being read, named, or retold.
- **A protocol, not one app.** The same law can run on more than one host. The Grimoire application runs this engine; its earlier form runs the same protocol on Claude Code with the perimeter enforced by harness permissions instead of engine code. One law, two hosts - that is the point.

A running theme of the work, and the reason for the honesty above: raising the model's system prompt was the wrong lever. Moving L3 data **out** of the system channel entirely - so the model receives law as law and data as data - did in one engine change what layers of defensive prose in an application could not. **Place in the structure is authority.** That result, and the ones still failing, are the substance; the numbers are being measured, not assumed.

## Core mechanics

- **Two roads, one code.** Canonical `!commands` bypass the model entirely (zero tokens); free-form requests reach the same functions through tool calling. The model interprets and narrates; code executes. A canonical command is fed back to the model as a real synthesized tool exchange, not pasted prose, so the model never re-issues what code already ran.
- **System prompt is L1/L2 only.** Boot data and all retrieved content arrive as conversation messages (marked L3), never in the system channel. The system carries law; the conversation carries data.
- **Perimeter in code.** Effects on disk are the engine's job: a write jail (realpath-rooted), a consent gate for destructive actions, and per-app write allowlists.
- **Retrieval-first memory.** Routing indexes stay in context; bulk content is fetched on demand and cited, not preloaded.

## Quick start

```
pipx install llm-as-code
cd your-app
lac
```

An application folder looks like:

```
your-app/
  .lac/
    llm_compose.yaml    # the anchor: all paths resolve relative to the app root
    law/                # L1/L2 law files
    souls/              # personas (L2)
    commands.py         # the app's command module (TOOLS + COMMANDS registry)
  <memory folders>      # L3 content
```

The engine finds `.lac/llm_compose.yaml` in the current directory (or in the directory passed as the first argument) and resolves every path in the compose against that root. No absolute paths anywhere.

Providers: Anthropic (raw HTTP, prompt + conversation caching, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from env only), Mistral (`MISTRAL_API_KEY`), and Ollama for local models. The vendor surface lives in one dispatch table, `adapter.PROVIDERS`, behind `adapter.send()`; any OpenAI-shaped API is one new entry.

Trust model: the commands module is application code (L0) and the engine executes it deliberately - running an app means trusting its code, the same way installing any package means trusting its authors. The levels protect L1/L2 from the model and from L3 content, not the machine from the app you chose to run.

## Status and roadmap

Pre-release. The spec ([SPEC.md](SPEC.md), methodology v0.2) is the canon; this engine tracks it through milestones M0-M3 (loader, retrieval commands, write perimeter, drift metrics), with an M4 opening on refusing destructive user commands. The current focus is a debt pass - stabilize every existing feature before adding more.

These are limitations of **this engine and the protocol** - application-level defenses and their bugs (datamarking, memory hygiene, persona discipline) live with each application, e.g. the Grimoire.

- **Injection is not solved.** Keeping L3 out of the system channel and enforcing the levels raises the bar, but no channel discipline makes a capable model incorruptible - residual behavioral drift is real. The engine's guarantee is that effects on disk are survivable (caged), not that the model always obeys. How hard a given application resists injection is measured, not assumed.
- **No tests or CI, no drift numbers yet.** The M3 harness (scripted turns, an LLM judge, deterministic checks, a model matrix) is designed but not built. Treat every claim here as a hypothesis under measurement.
- **Unstable surface.** APIs and the compose schema change without notice; SPEC.md still trails the engine on several points.
- **Behavioral hygiene varies by model.** Cheaper heads carry the mechanism but not the voice; stronger heads rationalize rather than obey. Perception is not a guarantee - which is the whole reason the perimeter is code.

## First application

[Grimoire](https://github.com/diranix/grimoire) - a personal memory system and the first LaC application. Its earlier implementation runs the same protocol on Claude Code, with the perimeter enforced by harness permissions instead of engine code: one law, two hosts.
