# Changelog

## 0.2.0 - 2026-07-20

Breaking: both changes below require a one-line compose/file move in existing apps.

- `llm.persona` compose key: the persona file gets its own slot instead of hiding in the `context.L2` list. It loads as L2 right after the L2 files; a missing persona file refuses boot like any missing law. Optional - apps without personas declare nothing.
- The commands module moved into the machinery folder under a fixed name: the engine now loads `.lac/commands.py` instead of `commands_<app>.py` at the app root. The app root belongs to the user's content; `.lac/` holds everything the app runs on, and the module name is no longer derived from `app.name`. Update the compose `levels.L0` path, rename the module file, and re-run `lac lock`.

## 0.1.5 - 2026-07-14

Injection defense: the authority channel. Behavior unchanged for well-behaved input; the change is where data sits.

- L3 out of the system prompt: the system channel now carries L1/L2 law only. Boot data (core, map, tree) and all retrieved content arrive as the first conversation message, marked L3 - so the model receives law as law and data as data. `build_context` returns `(law, data)`; the adapter's `split_context` becomes `law_of`, and all three providers (Anthropic, Mistral, Ollama) build `system` from law alone. This closes the case where injection-shaped L3 text rode the same channel a model is trained to read as authority.
- Canonical commands feed back as a real tool exchange: instead of pasting the command result into a user message, the REPL synthesizes an `assistant` `tool_use` plus a `user` `tool_result` into the history (uuid tool-call id, 9 chars for Mistral). The model sees the result in the channel it expects, so it no longer re-issues a command code already executed (the double-load bug).
- Removed the L1 restatement mechanism (`build_context` no longer tracks `l1_parts`); the after-data law repetition is gone. Cancelled canonical commands now roll their user message back out of the history.

## 0.1.4 - 2026-07-13

- Distribution renamed: `lac-engine` -> `llm-as-code` (matches the paper's "LLM as Code"). The import package stays `lac`, the command stays `lac`. The GitHub repo moves to diranix/llm-as-code; `lac-engine` on PyPI is retired at 0.1.3.

## 0.1.3 - 2026-07-13

Second audit pass: protocol integrity and cost.

- fsjail canary at boot: the engine attempts a jail escape and refuses to start unless it is refused - the lock is verified, not assumed (SPEC 5.2).
- to_ollama_messages and to_mistral_messages folded into one to_openai_messages(with_ids) converter; ollama tool results now follow their assistant message.
- Anthropic conversation caching: cache_control rides the last message when tools are on, so the growing conversation is cached, not only the system prompt; `llm.cache_ttl: "1h"` switches to the extended-ttl beta.
- env["law_size"]: the engine hands apps its boot-context size estimate, so context policies can budget the conversation net of the always-present law.
- ON_TEXT hook now receives env - `ON_TEXT(env, text)` - so app text gates keep state without module globals.
- readline import is optional (the engine starts on Windows); 429 retry honors a numeric Retry-After header.

## 0.1.2 - 2026-07-13

Full audit of the engine: correctness, portability, and readability - behavior unchanged unless noted.

- Explicit utf-8 on every file the engine reads or writes (compose, context files, fsjail writes); behavior no longer depends on the OS default encoding.
- Compose loader: clean `compose error` messages for bad yaml, a non-mapping file, and missing required keys (app, paths, llm, context, context levels) instead of raw tracebacks.
- Unknown llm provider is refused at boot, for the head and the worker both; adapter's send() dispatches through a PROVIDERS table and raises ApiError instead of killing the session mid-turn.
- `llm.max_tokens` is a compose key (default 2048) instead of a hardcoded constant; applies to the anthropic and mistral providers.
- http_post survives a non-JSON response body: ApiError instead of an uncaught exception.
- Ctrl-C during a command no longer kills the REPL; the command returns "interrupted by the user" and the session continues.
- engine.py split into named phases (load_compose, load_commands, build_context, run_command, repl, main) - same flow, readable units.
- to_ollama_tools renamed to_openai_tools - mistral sends the same shape.

## 0.1.1 - 2026-07-09

Two boot-and-read hardenings, found by review and verified live.

- Boot refuses a broken law: a missing L1/L2 context file stops the engine (`law incomplete - refusing to start`); the MISSING list now names each file's level. Missing L3 stays a warning.
- Read jail in the commands contract: an app's load command must resolve paths with realpath and refuse anything outside the memory root (`../` escape closed). Applied in the Grimoire app (lives with the app, not in this package); read-side counterpart of the M2 write fsjail.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-07-09

First packaged release of the reference engine.

- Engine as an installable package: `pipx install lac-engine`, global `lac` command.
- App root anchor: the engine finds `.lac/llm_compose.yaml` in the current directory (or the directory given as an argument); all compose paths resolve relative to the app root. No absolute paths.
- Compose loader with a strict parser: schema_version gate, unknown-key rejection, clear errors for a missing compose or commands module.
- Context assembler: law loads in trust order L1 -> L2 -> L3, always in context.
- Commands module loaded per app by explicit file path (`commands_<app>.py`, TOOLS + COMMANDS registry).
- Two roads to the same code: canonical `!commands` intercepted before the model (zero tokens); free-form language through tool calling into the same functions.
- Providers behind `adapter.send()`: Anthropic (raw HTTP, prompt caching on system, usage line, API key from env only) and Ollama.
- Published on PyPI as `lac-engine`.
- SPEC.md: the LaC methodology (v0.2) - definition, philosophy, compose schema, levels, commands, security model, memory hierarchy.
- Adapter hardened: request timeout, readable api errors instead of tracebacks, soft recovery (an API failure prints one line and rolls the conversation back; the REPL survives).
- Ollama path reconciled with the agentic loop: messages and tools translate both ways; the loop no longer sees the provider.
- Known debt: drift metrics (M3) not started; no tests or CI yet.
